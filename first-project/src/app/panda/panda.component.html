    The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca; Chinese: 大熊猫; pinyin: dàxióngmāo),[5] 
    also known as the panda bear or simply the panda, is a bear[6] native to south central 
    China.[1] It is characterised by large, black patches around its eyes, over the ears, and
     across its round body. The name "giant panda" is sometimes used to distinguish it from
      the red panda, a neighboring musteloid. Though it belongs to the order Carnivora, the 
      giant panda is a folivore, with bamboo shoots and leaves making up more than 99% of its 
      diet.[7] Giant pandas in the wild will occasionally eat other grasses, wild tubers, or 
      even meat in the form of birds, rodents, or carrion. In captivity, they may receive honey, 
      eggs, fish, yams, shrub leaves, oranges, or bananas along with specially prepared food.[</p>
